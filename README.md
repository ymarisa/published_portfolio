### Known issues / Still working on
1. Contact form doesn't send email.
1. Awkward card shuffling when changing filters.
1. Changing filters deselects nav bar selection
1. The h2 header is a different size on the About page and the Contact page.

   Different despite having the same element tag and is nested in the same types of tags
1. The profile image on the about page does not stack above the text when the screen is small 

   It shrinks but stays next to the text, squishing it

1. Blog widgets don't work yet
1. Blog styling needs more work to match the rest of the site
1. Blog entries don't overflow into a "more" page yet
